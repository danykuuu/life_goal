			Faults I notice with humanity's future:
		</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>In the short term, people lack care for the future because its a point in time where their current self doesn't exist. Often sacrificing their own future for the present.</li>
			<li>In the long term, Earth will run out of resources. We will need to become renewable or outsource.</li>
			<li>In the short term, the entire education needs to be heavily revised. </li>
			<li>In the long term, humanity should consider uniting under some baseline rules.</li>
			<li>However time corrupts all and a good structure will corrode if not well maintained.</li>

		<h2>Why?</h2>
		<p>
			Tech has boomed and it will continue to. It allows us to offload our human capabilities. As we continue to offload our abilities, our skills across the board will be lower however it allows us to specialise to an extreme degree. A boon to those who have found their specialization but a curse to those who don't
